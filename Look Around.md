# Look Around

There are free open-source systems available that deliver the same concept as ours but unfortunately, most of them remain with no update. Our approach aims to keep up-to-date and state pertinent information about the project to people interested in joining our team and using our system. The first step is to list existing and similar systems (both open source and non-open source).
